I was a bit tired \r\nhaving to always sync files and even though we have clients that handle this, \r\nit'd be so much better if they were a part of the file system. Using FUSE \r\nwould have been cross-platform but it would have required a bit more work and \r\nrecycling of effort so I decided to go up on more level and leverage the \r\ndesktop environment I used the most to handle the work for me. The enviroment \r\nmanages my passwords on Web forms, in cross-application synchronization of \r\nauthentication all thanks to KWallet so I figured why not?\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nThere's a few ways to open up KIO-powered paths. One is via the console and \r\nanother is via a KIO-enabled application.\r\n\r\n### Forming Paths\r\n\r\nThe path for services would be formed as follows:\r\n\r\n`cloud://[storage-service-identifier]/path/as/found/on/service`\r\n\r\nThe `storage-service-identifer` can be found in each of the services supported \r\nin the `slaves` directory. The following is a list of the ones currently \r\nsupported.\r\n\r\n + [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) - googledrive\r\n + [DropBox](https://dropbox.com) - dropbox\r\n\r\n### Via Console\r\nRunning just `kioclient` would provide you with information on how to use \r\n`kioclient` in the console. Executing the opening of a PDF file on Google \r\nDrive would be done like so:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nkioclient exec cloud://googledrive/resume.pdf\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Via GUI\r\nThe act of browsing cloud files from a GUI has yet to be written.\r\n\r\n# License\r\nThis code is licensed under a GPL v2 license.
